            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>8 ounces mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then coat them in flour.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the onion, mushrooms and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are softened and the onions are translucent.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by about half.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
        </li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the skillet and spoon the sauce over the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
