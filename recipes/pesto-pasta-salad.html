    <p>This pasta salad is a great option for a summer side dish or a light lunch. The homemade pesto sauce gives it a
        fresh and flavorful taste, and the cherry tomatoes add a pop of color and a touch of sweetness. It's a simple
        recipe but it packs a lot of flavor and can be served cold or at room temperature, making it a great option for
        a picnic or a potluck. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
